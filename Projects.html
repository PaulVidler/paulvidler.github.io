			<h4>LiDAR Aquisition flight lines and captured data</h4>
			<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/flightlines-small.PNG" alt="Flight lines" /></span>With the exception of some fairly basic scripting/automation,
				this was the first actual project I ever really took on, and boy oh boy, did I hugely underestimate the complexity of this seemingly simple task.
				When beginning this project I had the idea that I could use a pre-existing script that I had written in Python to turn raw flight log data into a KML that
				would visually display the logged data, including flight line run numbers, altitude etc. Then, I would show this data on a map in a web interface that could
				filter/search different days, aircraft and LiDAR sensors. It was mostly just a little database and text parsing, should be easy enough, right? Lol. I had little
				idea of what I was getting myself into. But holy moly, I learned a lot!!
				<span class="image left"><img src="images/flightlines3-small.PNG" alt="LiDAR Flight lines" /></span>
					I made my very first post to StackOverflow –
					https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54319492/mapping-project-i-want-to-show-kml-files-on-a-map-and-be-able-to-sort-them-bas/54327412#54327412
					and I awaited advice from the programming gods to point me in the right direction. A MASSIVE shout out to user https://stackoverflow.com/users/1892308/istopopoki
					who took the time to write a very informative post and gave some ‘getting started’ advice. The post had one key piece of text that kept me glued to my
					computer whilst I learned what I needed to to make this work.

				This one felt a little ambitious at first, but after a bit of research
				and study, I think I've got it nailed. Now I just have to complete it!<br />
				This project will contain a few moving parts, an Android app, some Azure app services and some Azure tble storage. This will be presetned on a front end site where my wife can track
				my position and see that I am not dead. Rad.
