				<h2>Welcome.....</h2>
			</header>
			My name is Paul and I am a software developer, working out of th Sunshine Coast in QLD, Australia. I have plans to working remotely and slow-pack the world with my
			best friend and wife, Lisa. I have always been lucky to be surrounded by legit professionals in the fields I work in and I'll be forever grateful
			to a select few individuals who have both mentored and allowed me to better myself in my chosen fields and personal pursuits.


			<p>I studied software and web development in the early 2000's, and although I never formally worked in software development until about 2018, I'd always had an interest
				in programming/web dev and was probably held back by my own self defeating monologue until I was lucky enough to earn a job that allowed me many hours each day to
				work on my programming skills in a professional capacity. Soon after, I met Mad-Dog, a kind-hearted psychopath
				who mentored me and gave me an incredible opportunity to chase these dreams on a full-time basis. I'll be forever grateful.
			</p>
			<p>
			<h4>Personal achievements</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Starting a successful small business</li>
				<li>Learning guitar (at 25) and playing shows across the country in my late 20's - 30's</li>
				<li>Going back to study in my 30's and working hard towards a career in Land Surveying/Spatial Sciences</li>
				<li>Taking up Brazilian JiuJitsu at 35. QLD State champ at u94kgs amateur in 2018, Silver medal in open weight division</li>
				<li>Career move into software development (Much more work than I expected)</li>
				<li>Zero kids</li>
				<li>Zero credit cards</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
			<h4>Education</h4>
			<p>I consider myself a life-long learner and I really enjoy learning new skills, especially things of a technical nature.
				As a result, I have an odd range of skills and qualifications and I know more about time-travel theory and physics than
				what should otherwise be considered reasonable for someone not still living in their mothers' basement.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Microsoft certified - AZ900 Azure Fundamentals</li>
				<li>Diploma in Web and graphic design</li>
				<li>Assoc Spatial Science â€“ USQ</li>
				<li>Registered as an Associate with the Surveyors Board of QLD</li>
				<li>Cert IV in Software development</li>
				<li>Cert III in Information Technology</li>
				<li>Cert IV marketing</li>
				<li>Cert IV in Business and managment</li>
				<li>About 800+ hours on Pluralsight in the last year,<br>of which I've retained about 25 mins.</li>
				<li>1 semester of Jazz college - After hours, for fun, until my head exploded.</li>
				<li>Too many others to list on Networking, active directory, Azure.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				Maybe you're a recruiter, maybe an old or current colleague, maybe my current (or future) boss. It doesn't matter to me,
				please check out my Blog or my Projects page if you've made it this far.
				Neither are terribly up to date, but regardless, you'll get a bit of an idea about who I am, my work ethic, and the kinds of problems I like to solve.
